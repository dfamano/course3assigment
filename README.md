Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the repo for the Course Assingment of the 3rd course of the Data Science Specialization in Cousera

The run_analysis.R script complete the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The description of code used was inserted within the script for easier understanding and further reference

Also, a codebook is provided in the repo for better reference on the variables in the 2 most important datasets:

a) tidy_dataset which is the one created following steps 1-4 above
b) summarydata which is the dataset created in step 5 above
